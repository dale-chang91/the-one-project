# The One Project (To House Them All)
The One Project Which Contains Everything

This application will contain several sub-applications. This design was chosen to reduce the number of incomplete Git projects that the owner tends to create. This way, each sub-application can re-use services from other sub-applications.

## List of Sub-Applications
